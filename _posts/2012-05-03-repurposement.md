Although I'm quite aware that to make another blog would be extremely free, I don't like the concept of wasting even on such a small scale. I feel a sense of sadness when I think about all of the web sites that never get visited and do not want to contribute to the problem. Even if other people don't visit it, the fact that I am contributing to it will be enough to stave off the sense of guilt associated with leaving a site to collect dust. I read a [story](https://japhr.blogspot.com/2012/04/366-or-how-i-tricked-myself-into-being.html) about a dude who blogged everyday for a year and proceeded to be awesome because of it.

I want to shamelessly steal his idea.

Here goes nothing.
