title: "How Can I Make a game that is not an FPS using UDK?"
---

Two days ago I mentioned that I found tutorials on how to make a video game using [UDK](http://udk.com/)(Unreal Development Kit) Thus far I have only gotten a little farther than navigating the menus but something that I noticed was that starting from scratch the developer gets a player with a gun it their hand when they initially play test their game.  
  
This had me very worried! I was starting to think that I had stumbled onto a glorified level editor for Unreal Tournament. This would not do! I needed to have complete freedom of expression! Because only then would I be able to craft my masterpiece!  
  
This is a pattern that I have noticed throughout my life. I start to learn a tool and don't even have any idea what I might do with it when I start worrying if it will do all the things that I want to do with it. I have a feeling that I should be less worried about what the limitations of my tools are and start thinking of new and creative ways to use what I have.  
  
All sidetracking aside, I watched a few reassuring videos of people doing cool out of the box thinking with UDK and [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF8yVi28uu8) that quickly explained how to turn the standard first person view into a third person view. Simply knowing that the tool affords me the capability to modify this situation was enough to calm my crazy face.  
  
### Kismet  
The tool that the video used was kismet which is a visual scripting tool used within UDK to control certain things. In this case the constant distance for the camera from the player. From afar it seems like a powerful tool that would be fun to play around with.  
  
I suppose I do find it strange that the used does need to do work to get to a blank navigation player. That is to say if you set up a scene that you just want to bodilessly float through you need to do some work just to undo the default setting.  
  
### In Sum  
- I need to be less worried about tool and more worried about goals; I can worry about the problems of restricted freedom of expression once I find that the tool is blocking me from making it  
- UDK has many really cool tools within it that I never thought about as someone who has never worked in real time.
