Java is an object-oriented language that appeared in 1995. It features C and C++ like syntax but features fewer low level functions. Java runs on top of the Java virtual machine. In this way the JVM is basicallyÂ indistinguishable from a physical processor with its own Instruction set.  
  
Java is a garbage collected language. This means that the developer doesn't have to worry about memory management. The garbage collector makes space on the memory heap so that there is memory for future processes.  
  
In addition Java is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable is checked at compile time to make sure it is of the correct type.
