title: "What kind of things can I do with Kismet?"
---

The more that I watch about Kismet the more that UDK looks like an intense version of LittleBigPlanet. In a level you can add proximity sensors and collision detection. Kismet also displays prompts on screen to the user and controls sounds. 

In the example that I watched, using kismet the teacher was able to modify the motion of a new camera object such that the camera's location and rotation was based on the player's x and y location and the players z rotation. This is in the same vein as the ability to make a different type of game with kismet. In addition, there is a checkbox to set it so that the player doesn't start off as though they are playing Unreal Tournament.  

Kismet uses a simple node based interface that is similar to Robolab. Users are able to define the response to specific triggers and perform various tasks and specify certain parameters. Another useful feature is that of named variables. These allow a user to separate the kismet script into various functional groups which means that the whole thing is more organized.  

### In Sum
Kismet is really where any new and interesting gametype is made.
