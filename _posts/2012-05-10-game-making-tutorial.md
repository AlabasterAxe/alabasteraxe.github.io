I have a bad habit of biting off more than I can chew and then abandoning my endeavors once I get sidetracked so in the spirit of doing things like I normally do, instead of using a "GameMaker" type software that would be easy yet restrictive to work with I decided that I want to learn the UDK or the Unreal Development Kit. Found a set of [video tutorials](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/VideoTutorials.html) that I want to follow.  
  
I want to be able to use Blender as my "3D Package" and then UDK as the thing that sews it all together.  
  
**In sum:**  
- I want to learn how to play around with real time 3D environments.
