I have been following the [video tutorials](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/VideoTutorials.html#3D%20Buzz%20Video%20Tutorials%20-%20Using%20UDK) referenced in [[2012-05-10-game-making-tutorial|this blog post]]. They have been really informative and are very well done. The videos go very in-depth and they don't take for granted that you have watched every video/remember everything from every video so he tends to err on the side of repetition. Overall, very well done.  
  
During this process, I started to have a growing sense of pointlessness about the whole process. All of these lessons were very interesting but I couldn't help but feel like it wasn't worth my time to learn all of this stuff if I didn't have some final project. So I wanted to come up with something that wasn't trivial(ie an FPS), wasn't a direct copy and was something I could be excited about.  
  
I decided that an extended version of Toy Home. I think that this is a great example of a game that would provide a significant challenge, would be something that I could add new functionality to such as new classes of vehicles and the like. Finally, I am energized by the thought of being able to play this with my friends possibly in the future.  
  
### In Sum
Toy Home is awesome and I want to make it using UDK.
